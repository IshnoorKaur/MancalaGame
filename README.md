# Mancala Game 

## Description

The Mancala Game project introduces a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for the classic Mancala game, offering two distinct rule sets: Kalah Rules and Ayoayo Rules. Players have the flexibility to choose between these versions, each providing a unique and engaging gaming experience.

In the Kalah version, players commence the game by gathering all the stones from any pit on their side and distributing them in a counter-clockwise fashion until none remain. Key rules include depositing stones in stores, earning free turns, and strategically capturing opponent's pieces under specific conditions. The game reaches its conclusion when one side's six pits are emptied, and victory is claimed by the player with the greatest number of stones in their store.

Ayoayo follows a similar initiation, with notable differences in gameplay. Stones are sown, excluding the starting pit, and redistribution occurs when the last stone lands in a pit with existing stones. The unique feature of Ayoayo involves capturing opponent's stones when the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player's side. The player with the most stones in their store at the conclusion of the game emerges as the triumphant strategist in this version of Mancala.
